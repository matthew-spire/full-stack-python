    - If one or the other is not installed, go to the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) website, download, and install Node.js and npm

## Dynamic Content and on_click Events
- Discussed the use of a button's (`rx.button()`) `on_click` action to change the state (`rx.State`) on the page, specifically the page's heading
- Use of the `self` parameter in the method definition to update the state (???)
- Reference the variable defined in the `State` class by using `State.variable_name` &rarr; This gets placed wherever you want the state to be updated (in our case, the page's heading)
